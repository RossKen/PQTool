# PQ Tool

## Running the tool

To run the tool:
1) Download the code
2) Point your working directory to the 'front_end' folder 
3) Open one of global.R, server.R or ui.R in RStudio then hit 'Run App'.

## Testing

### To run the tests you will need [RSelenium][1] and [geckodriver][2]

```
brew install selenium-server-standalone
brew install geckodriver
```

### Then you'll need to start the Selenium server in a new terminal

```
java -jar -Dwebdriver.gecko.driver=/<path_to_gecko>/geckodriver /<path_to_selenium>/selenium-server-standalone-3.3.1.jar
```

### And start your app (note that the test suite is pointed at port 8888)
```
runApp('/path_to_app/', port=8888)
```

### Now you can actually run the tests (from inside an R session)

```
devtools::test()
```
