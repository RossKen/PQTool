#A script to scrape the written questions that the MoJ has had since 4th June 2014 until the latest date.
#All data is scraped from the parliament website, http://www.parliament.uk.
#(4th June 2014 is the date which the parliament website goes easily back to)

#The data this scrapes is as follows:
#Question ID: the parliament website identifier for a question
#Question Text: self-explanatory
#Answer Text: where it exists
#Question MP: (or Lord/Lady where it's a House of Lords question)
#MP constituency: where the question is asked in the Commons, the constituency of the MP
#Answer MP: the minister answering the question
#Date: the date the question was asked
#Answer date: the date the question was originally answered
#Corrected date: the date the answer was corrected, if it was

#To use this, you'll need to use your web browser to go to the parliament website and find the page that gives
#the written questions and answers, which at the time of writing this is
#http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-questions-answers/
#Then you'll need to make changes so that it searches Ministry of Justice questions, and amend the date range
#appropriately. A good tip is to also change it so it's showing 100 questions per page.
#Then click 'go', and then copy and paste the resulting URL into the parameter below called 'link'.

#You need to also write where you want the results saved. 

#Once you've done this you should be able to now just run everything below here
#and it will spit out the results into the file you've specified above.

#I've had to clear up some rogue results semi-manually: for some reason (I think because of web connections)
#it occasionally throws up NAs for all of the data for some parliamentary questions.
#I'm afraid I've just cleaned up those by scraping those questions using the Qscrape function and inserting
#the answers in the right place.

  #question IDs have the same string of digits as other links on the page, at which point a

  #of digits in question, with often the wrong result. Whereas this way, though fiddly, gets results.
