68494,"To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, what her Department's rationale was for introducing a sliding scale of probate fees based on the worth of an estate.","The Government set out its rationale for reforming the fees for grants of probate in its response to consultation on the fees published on Friday 24 February. The Government is committed to providing a modern, world-leading justice system which is proportionate and accessible. The best way to protect access to justice is with a properly funded courts and tribunals service. Fees are necessary to support an effective courts and tribunals system that supports victims and vulnerable people, and is easy for ordinary people to use. In 2015/16, the Government spent around £1.9 billion on our courts and tribunals and recovered only around £700m through fees and other income. We do not believe that the taxpayer should continue to meet all of this cost. We are getting rid of flat fees and replacing them with a fair, banded, structure related to the value of the estate. This includes raising the fee threshold from £5,000 to £50,000 and lifting an extra 25,000 estates out of fees altogether. More than half of estates in England and Wales will pay no probate fee and over 90 per cent of estates will pay £1,000 or less. The fees will be implemented on a banded structure, increasing in line with estate values, meaning higher fees are paid by those who can afford to do so. No one will pay more than 1 per cent of the total estate value. Using the authoritative ONS projections, we have recently improved our estimates of the number of estates in England and Wales. With this more accurate data, we have produced a refreshed distribution of the estate values table. We have also updated our estimates to take account of HMRC’s most recent data on the distribution of estate values.  </em>These minor adjustments to Table 1 (page 11) of the consultation response do not alter the substance of, or rationale for, the proposals on which we consulted, or the Government’s decision to proceed with the changes. I have placed amended versions of the Government response to consultation in the libraries of the Houses. </em>   <table><tbody><strong>Value of estate (before inheritance tax)</strong></td><strong>Proportion of All estates in England and Wales</strong></td><strong>Proposed Fee</strong></td></tr>Up to £50,000 or exempt from requiring a grant of probate</td>53%</td>£0</td></tr>Exceeds £50,000 but does not exceed £300,000</td>25%</td>£300</td></tr>Exceeds £300,000 but does not exceed £500,000</td>12%</td>£1,000</td></tr>Exceeds £500,000 but does not exceed £1m</td>7%</td>£4,000</td></tr>Exceeds £1m but does not exceed £1.6m</td>1%</td>£8,000</td></tr>Exceeds £1.6m but does not exceed £2m</td>0.3%</td>£12,000</td></tr>Above £2m</td>0.6%</td>£20,000</td></tr></tbody></table>",Dr Matthew Offord,Hendon,Sir Oliver Heald,2017-03-20,2017-04-18

This is a key priority for the Government as we seek to make sure our prisons are safe, decent and secure and places of reform. Safe systems of work and health and safety systems are in place across the prison estate to ensure that staff work in an environment that is as safe and secure as possible and that they are supported to deal with the challenges of working with offenders.

We are comprehensively reviewing how we manage violence in prisons, with a view to introducing further improvements to ensure prisons are safer places for everyone. This will provide Governors/Directors with the tools to create safer prison environments and to help reduce re-offending.

Those employed as police officers and members of the Police Pension Scheme fund a normal pension age of 60 through higher employee contributions than those employed as prison officers and members of the Civil Service Pension Scheme. Police officers contribute 12.44% of their pensionable pay, whereas prison officers contribute 5.45% of their pensionable pay.

HL6156,To ask Her Majesty’s Government what was the rationale behind the new rates for grant of probate announced in the budget.,"The Government set out its rationale for reforming the fees for grants of probate in its response to consultation on the fees published on Friday 24 February. The Government is committed to providing a modern, world-leading justice system which is proportionate and accessible. The best way to protect access to justice is with a properly funded courts and tribunals service. Fees are necessary to support an effective courts and tribunals system that supports victims and vulnerable people, and is easy for ordinary people to use. In 2015/16, the Government spent around £1.9 billion on our courts and tribunals and recovered only around £700m through fees and other income. We do not believe that the taxpayer should continue to meet all of this cost. A key change will be the threshold under which no fee is payable increasing from £5,000 to £50,000. More than half of estates in England and Wales will pay no probate fees. The fees will be implemented on a banded structure, increasing in line with estate values, meaning higher fees are paid by those who can afford to do so. Over 90 per cent of estates will pay £1,000 or less for this service and no one will pay more than 1 per cent of the total estate in fees.",Lord Myners,NA,Lord Keen of Elie,2017-03-16,2017-03-27

And, in support of our commitment to tackle this threat, we have just invested an extra £3 million to improve intelligence analysis and searching capability across prisons and probation – this investment will increase our ability to identify and tackle corruption. A range of measures set out in the recent Prison Safety and Reform White Paper will further bolster our response to driving out corruption in prisons.

HL5997,To ask Her Majesty’s Government what assessment they have made of the relationship between the value of a deceased person’s estate and the cost of grant of probate; and whether the increases in the latter announced in the Budget represent the costs associated with the grant or will raise a surplus in addition to those costs.,"On Friday 24 February 2017, after careful consideration of responses to consultation, the Government announced its intention to introduce a new banded system of fees for grants of probate, subject to Parliamentary approval. The original Government consultation and the response can both be found on the Ministry of Justice consultation hub website. In 2015/16, the Government spent around £1.9 billion on our courts and tribunals and recovered only around £700m through fees and other income. The new probate fees are fair and proportionate in that they are linked to the value of the estate. Our plan to raise the threshold under which no probate fee is payable from £5,000 to £50,000 will ensure that more than half of estates will pay no fee at all. No one will pay more than 1% of the total estate value in fees. Parliament has given the Lord Chancellor the power, through section 180 of the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014, to set court and tribunal fees above the cost of the service. All of the additional income that the fees will raise must be reinvested back into our courts and tribunals. The Government is committed to providing a modern, world-leading justice system which is proportionate and accessible.

This includes key roles at each stage of the healthcare commissioning cycle, and the ability to decide how to structure their education regime, how it is sequenced and who provides it. These new responsibilities for prison governors will be accompanied by new accountability, buttressed by a set of performance standards that will hold them to account for the progress prisoners make. The budget for education and healthcare in 2015-16 was the responsibility of other Government Departments or a devolved function of the Welsh Government. The Department for Business Innovation and Skills allocated £128.9m for prison education in that year. The Department for Health allocated spend on offender health in 2015/16 but it is not possible to breakdown how much of this was spent in prisons. In the case of some Privately Managed Prisons, education and healthcare was delivered by the prison operator and funded as part of the overall contract price.

As well as applying our maths and English focussed core common curriculum which will be set nationally, prison governors will be encouraged to work with local employers and use labour market data to choose the right vocational training to help offenders into employment. Vocational and other qualifications can play an important part in communicating an individual’s competences in a clear and reliable way and acting as signposts for the progress he or she has made. Where it makes sense to accredit education and vocational training delivered in custody through the award of a qualification, the appropriate awarding body’s curriculum will be used to prepare the learner for the end assessment leading to the award of that qualification. GCSEs, A levels or other qualifications where studied for and achieved by adults in prisons are not included in the performance tables or national averages published by the Department for Education. Some prisoners are released on temporary licence to study at local Colleges: where a prisoner aged 18 is enrolled in learning with a mainstream provider outside the prison, qualifications achieved are included in the performance tables and national averages. All learners that take the GCSE or A Level qualification, including those taken in custody, are considered in national examination grade curves. Their results are included within the Joint Council for Qualifications’ published figures in the summer following the exams. Although the setting of the boundaries is informed by the subset of students that are matched to their prior attainment, which is not always possible with adult learners, the boundaries apply to all students. We intend, in future, to measure education and training in prisons by assessing a prisoner’s progress against milestones set out in their Personal Learning Plan, itself an element of the overall sentence plan. Studying for a GCSE or an A level should be part of a Personal Learning Plan where such study is appropriate. If such study is on the learner’s individual plan as a milestone, the prison’s governor will be accountable for performance towards its achievement",Mrs Anne Main,St Albans,Mr Sam Gyimah,2017-03-13,2017-03-20

67335,"To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, what steps she is taking to review the capability of (a) HM Prison Service and (b) contracted-out prisons to respond to incidents of concerted indiscipline.","Concerted indiscipline is defined as an incident in which two or more prisoners act together in defiance of a lawful instruction or against the requirements of the regime of the establishment. Such incidents can cover wide range of circumstances, with most quickly resolved locally but others requiring varying levels of more significant intervention. We are continually reviewing prisons across the public and private estates, and supporting them to mitigate the risk of serious incidents and provide effective responses to incidents that do occur. This process draws on a wide range of local data and intelligence reported daily by Governors, and assessed alongside other data, such as independent assessments from Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Prisons. I review this data regularly with the Chief Executive and other senior leaders. Interventions available to prevent risks escalating include deploying extra staff on detached duty and overtime, installing extra CCTV, or making fast improvements to building facilities where damage presents risks. Measures are also taken when appropriate to segregate prisoners, provide extra detection or blocking equipment and provide additional search teams. Under the mutual aid process, there are agreements between both public and private prisons which enable them to support each other to respond to significant incidents effectively. If the incident is significant enough, we bolster the local response by deploying specialist (Tornado) teams. Following this, we help stabilise prisons after incidents by transferring disruptive prisoners. In response to incidents in late 2016 we are improving this existing capability by resourcing two additional, national dog teams to support more perimeter patrols, helping prevent throw overs and drone operations.

Our recent White Paper on prison reform described how we have already stripped out unnecessary rules and governance from our education contracts to allow governors more oversight and control of existing services. Over the coming months, we will make prison governors fully responsible for education provision in their prisons once existing contracts end, commissioning the services they think are most appropriate in their individual prison. This will allow governors to decide how to structure their educational regime, and who delivers it, while following a core common curriculum set nationally which will focus on maths and English. To support this, prisons will create a personalised learning plan based on an assessment of need on reception, integrating it into the individual’s sentence plan, and we will use the same awarding bodies for particular types of provision to enable continuity of learning if prisoners move elsewhere. To ensure the quality of education delivery in prison improves, we will make sure that those providing that education have the right skills and capabilities to do so. The White Paper Prison Safety and Reform</em> set out a suite of performance measures through which governors will be held to account for outcomes in their prisons including educational progress made by prisoners. We will compare levels of attainment of maths and English on release with those at the start of custody, and look at the number of qualifications, or other accredited and work-focussed activity, prisoners complete.

NotesThe cost of a relock will depend upon the size of the prison establishment and on which keys have been lost or compromised.

We are currently looking at the work, training and education in prison to ensure that provision prepares prisoners to enter meaningful employment on release so that they are able to make an effective contribution towards society and break the cycle of re-offending. In 2015/16, on average 11,000 prisoners and detainees were working in custody at any one time across public sector prisons, contracted-out prisons and Immigration Removal Centres (IRCs). They delivered 16 million hours of work during the course of the year. These figures relate solely to industrial work, which is defined as work carried out in prison workshops (normally on the internal market, commercial work or for other government departments). There are also significant numbers of prisoners in other learning, vocational training or work opportunities within prison on tasks such as cooking, serving meals, maintenance and cleaning which can help them find a job on release and support their rehabilitation. The figures also exclude work placements undertaken by offenders on release from prison on temporary licence.<strong> </strong>The latest statistics relating to offender participation in education are published and can be found here: <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/further-education-and-skills-january-2017"" target=""_blank"">https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/further-education-and-skills-january-2017 Further data relating to offender education participation can be found here: <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/fe-data-library-further-education-and-skills"" target=""_blank"">https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/fe-data-library-further-education-and-skills We currently do not record the proportion of prisoners in employment.

As the data shows we have found a significant amount of drugs in 2016. This demonstrates the effective work by our prison staff to disrupt the supply of drugs in our prisons. We have taken a number of actions to make sure that we can do so. We have: implemented an innovative new drug testing programme, the first in the world to routinely test for psychoactive substances; trained over 300 drug detection dogs to specifically detect psychoactive substances; made it a criminal offence to possess any psychoactive substance in a custodial institution; and proposed legislative change, in the Prison &amp; Courts Bill, to make it easier for prisons to test prisoners for emerging dangerous psychoactive substances. We have also taken swift action to stop the supply of drugs into our prisons, equipping all prisons with portable and fixed detectors to tackle illicit use of phones in prisons. We are working with the police to catch and convict criminal using drones to smuggle contraband into prisons, and testing physical and technological countermeasures to stop incursions.The information requested is only available from October 2015 onwards and is in the following table. An enhanced incident reporting standard was implemented in October 2015 that allowed the recording for weight of drugs found in an incident. As more than one type of drug can be found in an incident, it is not possible to breakdown the weight for each type of drug found. Prior to October 2015, the system did not ask for the weight of drugs found to be recorded. Finds have increased between 2015 and 2016, this is likely due to better and more successful searching following these changes, as well as an increase in the number of incidents of people attempting to bring drugs into prisons. <table><tbody><td colspan=""6""><strong>Incidents of drugs found in prisons by weight, England and Wales, October 2015 to December 2016</strong></td></tr> </td> </td> </td> </td> </td> </td></tr><td rowspan=""2""><strong>Weight of drugs</strong></td><td colspan=""2""><strong>Number of incidents</strong></td> </td> </td> </td></tr>2015<sup>1</sup></td>2016</td> </td> </td> </td></tr> </td>979</td>3,577</td> </td> </td> </td></tr>2g to 5g</td>486</td>1,956</td> </td> </td> </td></tr>6g to 10g</td>164</td>570</td> </td> </td> </td></tr>11g to 20g</td>93</td>354</td> </td> </td> </td></tr>21g to 30g</td>72</td>265</td> </td> </td> </td></tr>31g to 40g</td>41</td>119</td> </td> </td> </td></tr>41g to 50g</td>22</td>127</td> </td> </td> </td></tr>51g to 100g</td>93</td>348</td> </td> </td> </td></tr>101g to 200g</td>60</td>256</td> </td> </td> </td></tr>201g to 300g</td>11</td>90</td> </td> </td> </td></tr>301g to 400g</td>10</td>48</td> </td> </td> </td></tr>401g to 500g</td>13</td>45</td> </td> </td> </td></tr>501g to 1,000g</td>8</td>50</td> </td> </td> </td></tr>More than 1kg</td>3</td>26</td> </td> </td> </td></tr>Unknown</td>533</td>2,643</td> </td> </td> </td></tr><strong>Total</strong></td><strong>2,588</strong></td><strong>10,474</strong></td> </td> </td> </td></tr> </td> </td> </td> </td> </td> </td></tr> </td> </td> </td> </td> </td> </td></tr> </td>2015<sup>1</sup></td>2016</td> </td> </td> </td></tr><strong>Estimated weight of drugs (kg)<sup>2</sup></strong></td>46.9</td>225.0</td> </td> </td> </td></tr> </td> </td> </td> </td> </td> </td></tr> </td> </td> </td> </td> </td> </td></tr><td colspan=""2""> </td> </td> </td> </td> </td></tr><td colspan=""3""><table><tbody> </td></tr></tbody></table></td> </td> </td> </td></tr> </td> </td> </td> </td> </td> </td></tr><td colspan=""3""> </td> </td> </td> </td></tr></tbody></table>(1) Data for 2015 covers October to December only(2) Estimated weight is calculated by summing the product of number incidents by the mid-weight of each weight category except for &quot;less than 1g&quot; and &quot;More than 1kg&quot;, where it uses 1g and 1kg respectively.

Which is why we are taking urgent and decisive action. Under measures introduced in late 2016, we can now apply for Telecommunications Restriction Orders at Court to block specific mobile phones being used in prisons. Since the legislation was introduced in August, we have had more than 150 mobile phones cut off. In addition, we have announced new measures in the Prison and Courts Bill that will allow the Secretary of State to authorise mobile network operators to block illicit mobile phone signals across entire prison sites. This will allow industry experts to work more creatively and effectively to block signals and means that we won’t require a court order to stop the illicit and harmful use of mobile phones in prisons.

64327,"To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, what recent steps her Department has taken to ensure that more prisoners leave prison with an identified employment, education or training outcome.","The government is committed to ensuring that prisoners gain the skills and qualifications they need so that they come out of prison better able to find work, better able to support their families and ready to turn their lives around.To ensure prisoners are prepared for life on release, from April 2017 governors will be measured on the rates of sustainable employment, including apprenticeships, and education in the period following release.To help governors to meet the standards to reform offenders and prepare prisoners for life on release, we are giving them freedom to design their regime to meet local delivery needs and target education, training and work in prisons to match the skills and qualifications prisoners need in the local labour market. Over 2017 and 2018, we will give governors control of the education budget to enable this. Prisoners could also, for example, work shift patterns to deliver new commercial contracts.Progress made in maths and English will also be measured, starting with qualifications gained from April 2017 and we are introducing testing on entry and exit in the longer term.In our Employment and Education Strategy, which will be published later this year, we will outline our plans to support prisoners in gaining the skills and experience they need to prepare them for employment on release.",Mrs Anne Main,St Albans,Mr Sam Gyimah,2017-02-17,2017-02-27

Previously, victims of domestic violence and others did not have to declare this information. The data provided therefore may not include all victims of domestic violence who received a payment of compensation from the CICA in 2016. This may also include those who suffered family violence.To ensure the application of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme is as robust as possible there are safeguards built in. If any applicant disagrees with a decision they can apply for a review. If they remain unhappy they can appeal to an independent tribunal. The table above includes cases in which the award was paid after review and appeal.The minimum award a victim of domestic abuse can receive under the Scheme is £1,000. However, additional or higher injury awards may be made for disabling mental injuries, depending on the length of time that the applicant’s symptoms persist. In some complex cases, where medical treatment is ongoing or the level of recovery is unknown, it may be in the best interests of an applicant not to settle their claim until the long term implications of an injury can be properly assessed.During 2016 CICA revised its operating model and undertook a major recruitment exercise to help improve the efficiency of the service it provides to applicants.

Our hard-working prison staff provide vital support to prisoners with mental health issues every day and last year we invested in specialist mental health training for officers. We also need to improve access to mental health services in the community. We are working with the Department of Health and NHS England to develop a new mental health protocol that will ensure timely access to mental health services so that courts are able to increase their use of mental health treatment requirements as part of a sentence.

We are committed to improving safety across the prison estate and are already taking action on the supply and use of dangerous psychoactive substances by prisoners. We have developed an innovative new drug testing programme, trained over 300 drug detection dogs to specifically detect psychoactive substances and introduced new legislation, which makes it a criminal offence to possess any psychoactive substance in a custodial institution. All prisons have robust risk assessments and control measures in place, including local first aid and healthcare provisions. If staff suspect they have been exposed to drugs or psychoactive substances, there are a range of support mechanisms available to them. This includes confidential counselling, occupational health services and care-teams in prisons. Following any suspected exposure, staff are also advised to visit the nearest Accident &amp; Emergency Department so that their symptoms can be treated and the appropriate medical advice can be received.",Mr Gary Streeter,South West Devon,Mr Sam Gyimah,2017-02-06,2017-02-14
63210,"To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, what assessment she has made of the effect of charges levied for a doctor's letter as evidence of domestic violence on the number of domestic violence claims; and if she will make a statement.","The Government is absolutely clear that victims of domestic violence must have access to the help that they need, including access to legal aid. Legal aid is available for the purpose of obtaining urgent protection via the courts and this funding is not subject to evidence requirements. Legal aid is also available, to those affected by domestic violence, for private family matters such as child contact and financial arrangements following separation. In these cases objective evidence is required and a letter from a health professional, which does not have to be a GP, is one of the types of evidence that can be accepted. We are aware that a small number of GPs have been charging for this but we do not believe that there is a need to do so. In July to September of 2016 the number of applications for legal aid for private family matters in which evidence of domestic violence is required was 26% higher than the same quarter of the previous year and the proportion of applications granted has increased to over 75% in the last three quarters.",Mr Jim Cunningham,Coventry South,Mr Sam Gyimah,2017-02-06,2017-02-09

Pay bill figures for men and women in each department can vary significantly based on representation at different grades and how many staff in the department are in full or part time work.

We reviewed the approach to ROTL in 2013 to ensure risks are being managed effectively and there is now a greater focus on: linking the ROTL activity to the individual’s sentence plan; countering any presumption to temporary release; and, an improved risk assessment and management approach, particularly with the most serious offenders. This has, however, had an unintended consequence – restrictions to improve risk management of the most serious offenders, have resulted in lower risk offenders not being able to benefit from ROTL. We will maintain the improvements made while allowing governors greater discretion in how they tailor their ROTL regime to the circumstances of each offender. We know that three of the most powerful factors helping to keep ex-offenders from re-offending are a good job, strong family ties and a stable place to live - ROTL makes all of them easier to achieve. Public protection is our top priority and we have no intention of changing the full risk-assessment offenders on ROTL must undergo and any non-compliance will be dealt with robustly.",Mr Jim Cunningham,Coventry South,Mr Sam Gyimah,2017-02-02,2017-02-09

If the court determines that a shared residence arrangement is necessary to meet the child’s welfare needs it can make an order to that effect. While the welfare of the child is the courts paramount consideration, the court must by law presume that the involvement of a parent in the life of the child concerned will further that child’s welfare, unless the contrary can be shown. The nature and extent of that involvement will then be determined by the court based on the facts in each case. In determining the child’s welfare needs the court will apply the factors set out in the ‘welfare checklist’ in the Children Act 1989. These include the ascertainable wishes and feelings of the child concerned, the impact on the child of any change in circumstances, and how capable each parent is of meeting the child’s needs. The court will also consider any harm the child has suffered or is at risk of suffering, which could include any harm from witnessing domestic violence.",Mr Laurence Robertson,Tewkesbury,Sir Oliver Heald,2017-01-25,2017-01-30

This informs the initial sentence plan, which the CRC must explain to the offender verbally and in writing to ensure they understand how they must behave and what they must do to comply with their sentence.

The Institute of Paralegals is an independent, non-statutory body that paralegals can choose to become members of. It sets standards and promotes its members as professional paralegals and has created the Professional Access Scheme which brings together various initiatives designed to widen access to legal careers, increase diversity within the sector and provide better careers information. The Lord Chancellor has met with the legal profession on a number of occasions to discuss how best to advance diversity, notably a recent roundtable of City firms, the Bar and the Senior judiciary. She has made it clear that widening the talent pool, including identifying opportunities to improve social empowerment and mobility for those wishing to enter the legal profession is one of her main priorities.

The introduction of a specific reporting category was accompanied by an educational piece on how prisons should report incidents and for what purpose in order to help inform the developing threat picture and advise the national response. Best practice is also shared regularly through security nudges direct to prison mailboxes, senior leader bulletins and frequent prison visits to promote practical support.",Richard Burden,"Birmingham, Northfield",Mr Sam Gyimah,2017-01-18,2017-01-26

This includes implementing the recommendations of a review of the Assessment, Care in Custody and Teamwork (ACCT) process, the multi-disciplinary case management process that is the main tool for managing prisoners at risk of suicide and self-harm. Providing the right intervention and treatment is vital to improving the outcomes for people who are in distress, and all prisons have established procedures in place to identify, manage and support people at risk of suicide or self-harm. But we recognise that more can be done. That is why we have invested in specialist mental health training for prison officers and allocated more funding for prison safety.

Our recent White Paper sets out the specific steps that we are taking to improve safety. They include investing over £100m to recruit an additional 2,500 staff across the estate by the end of 2018.The National Offender Management Service has launched a suicide and self-harm reduction project, led by an experienced prison governor, which is driving work in this area. This includes implementing the recommendations of a review of the Assessment, Care in Custody and Teamwork (ACCT) process, which is the main tool for managing prisoners at risk of suicide and self-harm. ACCT is a multi-disciplinary case management process which includes support plans that reflect prisoners’ individual needs, including any that are related to their progress through sentence.The Government is committed to making prisons safe. Reducing self-inflicted deaths is a key priority for the Government.As part of this, providing the right intervention and treatment is vital to improving the outcomes for people who are suffering and all prisons have established procedures in place to identify, manage and support people with mental health issues or at risk of suicide or self-harm.But we recognise that more can be done. That is why we have invested in specialist mental health training for prison officers, allocated more funding for prison safety and have launched a suicide and self-harm reduction project to address the increase in self-inflicted deaths and self-harm in our prisons.These improvements and reforms will benefit any prisoner who is vulnerable, suffering from a mental health problem or at risk of committing suicide – including a prisoner serving a sentence of imprisonment for public protection (IPP).

55241,"To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, what the timetable is for (a) recruitment and posting of the extra prison officers and (b) the special measures for vulnerable and mentally ill inmates announced in November 2016.","The Justice Secretary announced major reforms to the prison system in the Prison Safety and Reform White Paper published on 3 November, to cut reoffending and help reduce crime.To achieve this, we are investing more than £100 million to boost the frontline with 2,500 extra staff by the end of 2018. This will help drive forward our reforms to reduce violence, improve standards and increase the staff to prisoner ratio. One of our first steps will be to invest an extra £14 million at 10 priority sites, including HMP Berwyn in Wales, which will pay for an extra 400 prison officers.Governors are critical to the successful delivery of safe prisons. That is why from April 2017, we are giving governors the power and budget to determine how their prisons are run. This includes governors having the authority to do their own workforce planning, decide what staffing structures best meets their local needs and deciding how to deploy extra staff in prisons.With regards to special measures for vulnerable and mentally ill inmates, it is vitally important that we provide the appropriate mental health care to prisoners to support their rehabilitation. That is why we are giving prison governors more say in delivering healthcare services in their prisons.As part of these reforms, we will move to a joint approach to commissioning health services in England. Governors, working closely with local health commissioners and clinical experts, will be involved in the decision making process at each stage of the commissioning cycle. In Wales, where health is a devolved matter, we will liaise with the responsible Local Health Boards and the Welsh Government.All prisons have procedures in place to identify, manage and support people who are at risk of harm to themselves.All new intake prison officers receive mental health awareness training as part of their entry level training.",Paul Flynn,Newport West,Mr Sam Gyimah,2016-11-28,2016-12-16

The then Lord Chancellor, however, considered that the evidence provided in the LSB report did not adequately demonstrate that reservation was the best solution to the identified problems in the will writing market, or that other measures had been sufficiently exhausted in seeking to address these problems.

We have rolled out tests for new psychoactive substances, and have trained 300 dogs to detect these drugs. We have introduced tough new laws which will see those who smuggle packages over prison walls face up to two years in prison.
