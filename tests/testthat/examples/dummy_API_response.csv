http://data.parliament.uk/resources/724182,Home Office,false,2017-04-27,"<p>The Home Office consulted extensively with local authorities on their capacity to host unaccompanied children to arrive at the number of additional children they could take under section 67. Over 400 local authority representatives attended events in England, Scotland and Wales. On 8 September 2016, the Minister for Immigration wrote to local authorities to ask them to confirm their capacity to host all unaccompanied asylum seeking children, regardless of how they reached the UK. Local authorities told us they had the capacity to support 480 unaccompanied children. This capacity was in addition to the more than 4,000 unaccompanied children already in local authority care.</p><p>The migration crisis has shown that pull factors, such as policy changes and political messaging, can influence the movements of migrants. Approximately two thirds of asylum-seekers in the EU last year chose to travel to Germany and Sweden after passing through many safe countries en route. Whether it is push or pull factors that motivate children to come to Europe, it is always in the child’s best interest to enable them to come before they need to make dangerous journeys to Europe and before they become unaccompanied. That is why the Government’s strategy is to resettle the most vulnerable refugees directly from the regions; this is how we stop traffickers and smugglers from exploiting vulnerable people and children affected by conflict. In 2016, we resettled more than 5,000 people under the Syrian Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme and the Vulnerable Children’s Resettlement Scheme.</p>",Scarborough and Whitby,Mr Robert Goodwill,NA,2017-04-27T12:38:43Z,NA,http://data.parliament.uk/resources/724182/answer,Biography information for Mr Robert Goodwill,http://data.parliament.uk/members/1562,http://data.parliament.uk/resources/724182/answer,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://data.parliament.uk/resources/724182/answer,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,Home Office,Home Office,2017-04-25,Refugees: Children,1,House of Commons,"To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, what information her Department holds on local authority capacity to accept refugee children under the Dubs scheme and allegations that the Dubs scheme has encouraged traffickers to exploit such children.",false,Biography information for Carolyn Harris,Swansea East,Carolyn Harris,71837

http://data.parliament.uk/resources/723114,Ministry of Defence,false,2017-04-26,"<p>British Forces are involved in more than 30 operations in over 20 countries. We are effectively protecting the UK and its interests from a range of threats, and promoting security in key regions of the world.</p><p>Protecting the UK.</p><p>We continue to defend UK airspace with an integrated Air Defence system that includes Quick Reaction Alert Typhoon aircraft held at continuous readiness, Voyager tankers, and air surveillance and control facilities. We also provide such capabilities to police NATO airspace alongside our allies. Royal Navy assets defend our territorial waters and overseas territories, and maintain our Continuous At Sea Deterrent.</p><p>The Ministry of Defence (MOD) continues to ensure that the support it provides to the Government response in the event of a UK terrorism incident is in line with the current threat. The MOD has 10,000 military personnel available on standby at short notice to assist the civil authorities for significant terrorist incidents, supported by a wide range of niche military experts and equipment, such as bomb disposal specialists. The Police and maritime authorities have primacy for domestic security of the UK coastline against criminal elements but the MOD maintains forces to provide support to these authorities as required.</p><p>Counter-Daesh, Operation SHADER.</p><p>In Iraq and Syria, Operation SHADER is the UK's military response to the threat posed by Daesh. As part of the Global Coalition, the RAF is conducting airstrikes in support of local forces - the Iraqi Security Forces (including the Kurdish Peshmerga) and the Syrian moderate opposition - who are taking the fight to Daesh. British military training teams are providing highly valuable training to Iraqi forces in infantry skills, counter-IED techniques, medical skills and engineering expertise. This is part of the Government's overall strategy to defeat Daesh which includes stifling Daesh's finances; preventing the flow of foreign terrorist fighters across borders; supporting stabilisation efforts in areas liberated from Daesh; and exposing Daesh's delusional and false-religious narrative through counter-messaging.</p><p>Middle East.</p><p>We continue to underpin our enduring contribution to the security of the Gulf through the deployment of significant maritime and air capabilities. We have further reiterated our commitment to the Gulf States with two recent deployments. The first of these was HMS Daring, which deployed to the Gulf and the Southern Red Sea in October 2016 for seven months, protecting vital shipping lanes and ensuring maritime security. The second was the commitment of the UK's amphibious task group under HMS Ocean, which commanded the regional US-led Coalition Task Force 50 for the first time, from 25 November 2016 to 14 February 2017.</p><p>NATO.</p><p>As part of NATO's enhanced Forward Presence, we have 800 personnel deployed in Estonia and 150 in Poland. We have 30 personnel deployed on NATO's mission in Kosovo and Headquarters Allied Rapid Reaction Corps and the UK Joint Force Air Component are on standby as NATO Response Force (NRF) Component Commands. In addition, we are leading the land element of the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force with 3,000 personnel on standby to deploy rapidly if required. We have deployed Typhoon fast jets to Romania for four months as part of NATO's enhanced Southern Air Policing mission, and we are also contributing Royal Navy warships and Royal Air Force aircraft to the NRF.</p><p>Afghanistan.</p><p>The UK Government continues to make a key contribution to NATO's non-combat train, advise and assist mission which is helping the Afghan National Defence and Security Forces to build security and stability for the long term. The UK has 500 troops in Afghanistan serving in a non-combat role, alongside our NATO partners as advisers in the Afghan security ministries and to the Afghan Air Force, and provide security for NATO Forces in Kabul. As the coalition lead for the Afghan National Army Officer Academy, the UK has helped to train over 2,000 officer cadets, who will be the next generation of military leaders.</p><p>Countering Illegal Migration.</p><p>The Royal Navy has been at the forefront of NATO's activity in the eastern Mediterranean tackling illegal people trafficking and irregular migration in the Aegean Sea. Between March 2016 and January 2017 a Royal Navy or Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship was deployed to the Aegean in support of the Turkish and Greek coastguards. NATO's activity in the Aegean has contributed to a 98% reduction in people attempting to make the dangerous crossing between Turkey and Greece.</p><p>We continue to provide a vessel to the EU's Operation Sophia, which aims to disrupt migrant smuggling in the Mediterranean, and are supporting training of the Libyan coast guard. The UK also has the command of the EU Op Atalanta counter-piracy mission off the Horn of Africa.</p><p>UN Peacekeeping and Training Missions in Africa.</p><p>The UK is increasing its commitment to UN peacekeeping. We have 200 troops on the ground in the UN Mission in South Sudan, set to reach over 350 by May, undertaking vital engineering and medical tasks. Over the last 12 months we have committed up to 70 troops to the UN support mission in Somalia.</p><p>Elsewhere in Africa we have training missions in Nigeria and Somalia, as well as contributing to the EU mission in Mali.</p>",Sevenoaks,Sir Michael Fallon,NA,2017-04-26T16:07:46Z,NA,http://data.parliament.uk/resources/723114/answer,Biography information for Sir Michael Fallon,http://data.parliament.uk/members/88,http://data.parliament.uk/resources/723114/answer,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://data.parliament.uk/resources/723114/answer,NA,NA,NA,NA,11,Defence,Defence,2017-04-21,Peacekeeping Operations,1,House of Commons,"To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, what recent assessment he has made of the progress of all current military operations by sea, land and air; and if he will make a statement.",false,Biography information for Sir Nicholas Soames,Mid Sussex,Sir Nicholas Soames,71590
