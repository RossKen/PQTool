Data sources and quality The figures in these tables have been drawn from administrative IT systems which as with any large scale recording system are subject to possible errors with data entry and processing. The average length of time spent by prisoners on remand in each prison for each year since 2010 could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.

73,64656, To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what proportion of prisoners completed GCSE English courses in the last (a) year (b) two years and (c) five years. , Data is collected in respect of participation and achievement in Level 2 English courses (equivalent to GCSE standard). These can be found at: https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/576930/feandskills-OLASS-participation-and-achievement.xlsx These data refer to English courses funded by the Offender Learning and Skills Service (OLASS) in English prisons. Historically data specific to the completion of GCSE English courses is not collected. In Wales responsibility for learning and skills in prisons is devolved to the Welsh Government and this specific data breakdown is not routinely held centrally but is held locally at specific sites. ,Susan Elan Jones, Clwyd South ,Mr Sam Gyimah,20 February 2017, 19 April 2017 ,N/A
74,66584, To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what estimate she has made of the average cost of employing a prison officer in bands 3 to 5 (a) this year and (b) in each year from 2018-19 to 2020-21. , The average annual cost to NOMS (including employers’ pension and National Insurance contributions) of employing Prison Officers in Bands 3 to 5 in 2016-17 is set out in the table below [it should be noted that there will be variances depending on the prison and role of the prison officer].BandAverage Annual cost (£)Custodial Manager: Band 546 000Supervising Officer: Band 441 400Prison Officer Specialist: Band 441 300Prison Officer: Band 336 700 The cost of employing Prison Officers in future years cannot be accurately estimated as rates of pay are determined annually by the independent Prison Service Pay Review Body (PSPRB) and are therefore not yet known. ,Richard Burgon, Leeds East ,Mr Sam Gyimah,06 March 2017, 19 April 2017 ,N/A
75,66771, To ask the Secretary of State for Justice with reference to the oral contribution of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice of 1 March 2017 Official Report column 101WH on suicide and self-harm in prison (England) how much funding her Department plans to allocate to the Samaritans; and what the targeted support for prison staff and prisoners provided by that charity will consist of. , The total amount of our funding to the Samaritans for 2017-18 has yet to be finalised although we have confirmed already that they will receive the same amount as this year (£500k) to support the Listeners scheme through which volunteer prisoners are trained to provide support to other prisoners in emotional distress. Founded in 1991 this is a very successful scheme through which over 90 000 face-to-face support meetings were facilitated in 2016. In addition to funding the Samaritans for the Listeners scheme as part of plans to reduce levels of suicide and self-harm we have agreed in principle to fund a number of other projects proposed by the Samaritans and final decisions on the level of funding will be made by the end of the year. These additional projects include producing an online learning tool for prison staff based on a similar product developed by the Samaritans for the rail industry and piloting training for prisoners in building emotional resilience during their early days in custody with the training to be delivered by released ex-Listeners. ,Luciana Berger," Liverpool, Wavertree ",Mr Sam Gyimah,06 March 2017, 19 April 2017 ,N/A
76,67528, To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how much her Department has spent on utility bills in prisons which have been officially closed in each of the last five years. , Where the Ministry of Justice has closed prisons the level of services such as heating water and electricity is reduced to that necessary to maintain the fabric of the buildings and ensure the sites remain safe and secure until final disposal. The expenditure on utility bills in prisons which have been officially closed in each of the last five years is set out in the table below: Utilities costs of prisons officially closed in the past five years Financial year£2012-134 410 8252013-142 754 5722014-151 699 7522015-161 867 7532016-17 (to December 2016)508 359 Footnotes1. Utilities includes: fuel; electricity; gas; and water & sewage.2. The costs shown reflect invoices which have been submitted and paid. There is a time lag between services which have been supplied and the submission of invoices by suppliers. The figures may not therefore reflect the extent of the services received during the period.3. The figures provided are drawn from our central accounting system and although care is taken when processing data this may be subject to the inaccuracies and inputting errors inherent in any large scale recording system.4. Expenditure includes that at local (establishment) level and central (MoJ Estates Directorate) level. ,Tim Farron, Westmorland and Lonsdale ,Mr Sam Gyimah,13 March 2017, 19 April 2017 ,N/A

78,51946, To ask the Secretary of State for Justice whether any of the 2 500 extra prison staff announced in the Prison Safety and Reform white paper published by her Department on 3 November 2016 will be allocated to privately-run prisons. , The planned recruitment of an extra 2 500 new prison officers relates to public sector prison staff which will allow these prisons to implement the new staffing model outlined in the Prison Safety and Reform White Paper. Private providers are required to maintain a sufficient number of staff with the requisite level of skill and experience to ensure that the Prison is safe secure and decent environment. We are engaging with private providers on how the new staffing model outlined in the Prison Safety and Reform White Paper will be implemented in private prisons. ,Caroline Flint, Don Valley ,Mr Sam Gyimah,04 November 2016, 18 April 2017 ,N/A

81,59744, To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what the average caseload for probation staff was during each of the last three years for the (a) National Probation Service and (b) Community Rehabilitation Companies in (i) England and (ii) Wales. , The Ministry of Justice publishes statistics showing the total caseload of the probation service (the National Probation Service (NPS) and the 21 Community Rehabilitation Companies) and also staff in post in the NPS. Figures for total probation caseload are published quarterly in the Offender Management Statistics Bulletin England and Wales: https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/offender-management-statistics-quarterly Figures for NPS staff in post are also published quarterly in the National Offender Management Service Workforce Statistics Bulletin: https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-offender-management-service-workforce-statistics Figures on the average caseload of probation officers are not collected centrally.

85,67138, To ask the Secretary of State for Justice for what reasons she is proposing a negative discount rate for personal injury claims calculations; and if she will make a statement. , I refer my Honourable Friend to the Written Ministerial Statement (Justice update: Written statement - HCWS503) made by my Right Honourable Friend the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice on 27 February 2017 and the statement of reasons referred to in it. The statement was laid in the libraries of both Houses and published on the internet at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/discount-rate-summary-of-reasons. ,Mr Laurence Robertson, Tewkesbury ,Sir Oliver Heald,08 March 2017, 18 April 2017 ,N/A
86,68494, To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what her Department's rationale was for introducing a sliding scale of probate fees based on the worth of an estate. , The Government set out its rationale for reforming the fees for grants of probate in its response to consultation on the fees published on Friday 24 February. The Government is committed to providing a modern world-leading justice system which is proportionate and accessible. The best way to protect access to justice is with a properly funded courts and tribunals service. Fees are necessary to support an effective courts and tribunals system that supports victims and vulnerable people and is easy for ordinary people to use. In 2015/16 the Government spent around £1.9 billion on our courts and tribunals and recovered only around £700m through fees and other income. We do not believe that the taxpayer should continue to meet all of this cost. We are getting rid of flat fees and replacing them with a fair banded structure related to the value of the estate. This includes raising the fee threshold from £5 000 to £50 000 and lifting an extra 25 000 estates out of fees altogether. More than half of estates in England and Wales will pay no probate fee and over 90 per cent of estates will pay £1 000 or less. The fees will be implemented on a banded structure increasing in line with estate values meaning higher fees are paid by those who can afford to do so. No one will pay more than 1 per cent of the total estate value. Using the authoritative ONS projections we have recently improved our estimates of the number of estates in England and Wales. With this more accurate data we have produced a refreshed distribution of the estate values table. We have also updated our estimates to take account of HMRC’s most recent data on the distribution of estate values. These minor adjustments to Table 1 (page 11) of the consultation response do not alter the substance of or rationale for the proposals on which we consulted or the Government’s decision to proceed with the changes. I have placed amended versions of the Government response to consultation in the libraries of the Houses.

87,69461, To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what her policy is on Hull City Council conducting an inquiry into the baby ashes scandal with terms of reference similar to the Emstrey Inquiry. , I refer to my previous answers on this subject in particular the one I gave on 1 December 2016 to questions 54429 to 54440. The Government’s priority is to press ahead with the work already underway to improve infant cremation practices for families across the country. The decision whether or not to conduct an inquiry is for the Council. ,Diana Johnson, Kingston upon Hull North ,Dr Phillip Lee,28 March 2017, 18 April 2017 ,N/A
88,69889, To ask the Secretary of State for Justice pursuant to the Answer of 27 February 2017 to Question 64306 how the post-implementation review of the legal aid changes made by the Legal Aid Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 will be conducted; and by what means members of the public will be able to submit evidence to that review. , To begin the process of reviewing the Legal Aid Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (LASPO) the Government plans to submit a Post Legislative Memorandum to the Justice Select Committee shortly. We will outline our plans for the post-implementation review (PIR) of LASPO in more detail when we submit the memorandum to Parliament. It is our intention to work closely with key parties across the sector to inform the review’s conclusions. ,Mr Barry Sheerman, Huddersfield ,Sir Oliver Heald,29 March 2017, 18 April 2017 ,N/A
89,69839, To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what representations she has received on the operation of the Code of Practice for Victims of Crime. , Concerns have been raised about the operation of the Code of Practice for Victims of Crime and we are actively considering how compliance might be improved and monitored. We have committed to set out our strategy for victims by 2018. Representations on the Code of Practice will inform this work. The Commissioner for Victims and Witnesses Baroness Newlove regularly reviews the operation of the Code of Practice. She has published a number of reviews including about Victim Personal Statements on 18 January and on 22 February published a review of children’s entitlements in the Code of Practice. The Department received representations on 23 January from Voice4Victims containing case studies of victims’ experiences including apparent failures to receive their entitlements under the Code of Practice. The Department’s Ministers and officials regularly engage with victims’ organisations in relation to victims’ policy matters to understand issues and concerns as well as to make sure that they can contribute to policy work. On 14 March I attended the cross-party Victims’ Forum convened by Voice4Victims and chaired by Baroness Brinton of Kenardington to listen to the concerns of victims and victims’ groups about the operation of the Code of Practice. We anticipate receiving further written representations from members of the Forum and other information on victims’ experience of the criminal justice system. Ministers and officials are engaging and working with agencies with responsibilities under the Code of Practice about the operation of it and concerns that have been raised. ,Jess Phillips," Birmingham, Yardley ",Dr Phillip Lee,29 March 2017, 18 April 2017 ,N/A

93,69823, To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many (a) official and (b) official sensitive documents have been recorded as lost by her Department since 8 May 2015. , The information requested is not held centrally. The Ministry of Justice requires its staff to report any actual or suspected breaches of physical personnel or procedural security to the security incident officer in a clear and timely manner. In circumstances where an incident involving the loss of information has occurred staff are required to complete a security incident form which identifies the highest classification of information affected. The volume of documents however is not recorded. The Ministry of Justice takes any loss of information very seriously and all reported breaches are subjected to an initial security risk assessment with further action taken on a proportionate basis. ,Tim Farron, Westmorland and Lonsdale ,Dr Phillip Lee,29 March 2017, 18 April 2017 ,N/A

98,69682, To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what recent steps she has taken to reduce barriers experienced by pregnant women in accessing justice; and if she will make a statement. , The Government’s reforms to the scope of civil legal aid were designed to refocus funding on those who need it most and for the most serious cases in which legal advice and representation was justified. We have specifically protected legal aid (both for initial advice and representation) subject to the statutory means and merits tests for civil legal services provided in relation to contravention of the Equality Act 2010. Publicly funded advice continues to be available for Employment Tribunal discrimination claims and publicly funded advice and representation is available in the Employment Appeal Tribunal. This therefore includes funding for new and expectant mothers who may have experienced discrimination. ,Chris Elmore, Ogmore ,Sir Oliver Heald,29 March 2017, 18 April 2017 ,N/A
