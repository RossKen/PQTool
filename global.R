#Search space for query vector
vocab <- search.space$dimnames[[1]]

#Function to vectorize query - steps here need to match those in the cleanCorpus 
#function in the DataCreator file so that we are consistent in our treatment.
#This program requires the argument "query", which is the search text, and the 
#global object "vocab", defined above, which is our global vocabulary comprised
#of all the words in our corpus of PQs (appropriately stemmed and so on).

#The idea behind it is to use the sparsity of a normalised lsa space, so that
#cosine calcuations can be done with fast vector sums.  
#
#In a normalised lsa space, we have a rank-reduced term document matrix with
#columns (corresponding to documents) normalised to length 1.  By
#pre-processing the query into a binary vector, each query-document dot product
#q^Td is simply the sum of the entries of the column corresponding to d, but
#only those entries corresponding to terms (rows) found in the query. 
#We have q^Td = |q||d|cos(t) (where t is the angle between q and d), |d| = 1
#for all documents, and |q| is constant for a given query, we obtain a constant
#multiple (|q| times) of the cosine between q and d by doing this quick summation
#(made quicker thanks to Karik introducing me to data.table).

#If you change this you also need to change cleanCorpus function in
#the dataCreator.R file
